5 must read books to learn Object Oriented and Java Design patterns - Best of lot

五本最佳的Java面向对象理论和设计模式的书籍

Knowledge of Object oriented design principle and various design pattern is must for any Java developer. As I said earlier on 10 OOPS and SOLID design principles, coding without knowing these principles are like trying to learn language without knowing alphabets. By the way there are several books written on Object oriented design principles, design patterns and best practices, but only few of them provides what they claim. There are two things here, design principles and design patterns, one is basic and other is best practice built on that basic. One should first learn Object oriented principles and then learn design pattern to see how those principles are used to solve day to day problems. Keeping this in mind, I have collected following list of 5 books to learn Object oriented basics and design patterns in Java. These books are ordered from a beginners to advanced perspective. J2EE design patterns are little different than core Java design patterns but equally important for a Java developer, core J2EE patterns books is a good choice to learn that.

对于Java程序员来说，掌握面向对象的设计理论和一些设计模式是必备技能。就像我在另一篇博客[Java程序员应该知道的10个面向对象理论](http://javarevisited.blogspot.hk/2012/03/10-object-oriented-design-principles.html)中提到的，不学理论就开始编程，就类似于学习一种语言而不学习字母表。市面上有很多有关面向对象理论的、设计模式的和最佳实践的，但只有很少的书真正值得我们阅读。这里涉及两件事情，一个是面向对象理论，一个是设计模式。前者是基础，后者是在基于基础的最佳实践。我们应该先学习面向对象理论，再学习设计模式，来看看这些理论是如何帮助我们解决日常碰到的问题的。我为大家选择了以下的五本书，帮助大家学习面向对象理论和设计模式。这些书从浅到深。J2EE的设计模式和核心Java设计模式有一点点区别，但对Java程序员来说，核心的J2EE设计书籍也是学习的一个不错的选择。

Top 5 books on Java design patterns

有关Java设计模式的最好的五本书

Here is my list of books to learn object oriented and Java design patterns. Design patterns are tried and tested way to solve a problem in a context. These patterns are discovered while solving similar problems multiple times over the year and they address some of the most common task in object oriented application development e.g. creating object, structuring code,  dynamic behavior based on context and object etc. Following five books are great resource to learn Java design patterns, which is equally applicable to any other object-oriented programming language. If you know any other book on design patterns, which is worth reading, then please share with us.

以下是我学习面向对象和设计模式的书籍清单。设计模式是前人在解决某些相似问题时总结出的最佳实践。下面的五本书也适用于其他的面向对象语言。如果你知道其他优秀的设计模式的书籍，请推荐给我们。


Head First Design Patterns by Elisabeth Freeman, Eric Freeman, Bert Bates, Kathy Sierra, Elisabeth Robson

This was the first book, I read on head first series and design pattern as well, prior to that I have no idea, when to use abstract class or interface or Why composition is better than Inheritance. I usually code each feature and requirement as they come and end of doing more changes, more testing and introducing more bugs in first few years of software development. Thanks to my appetite of learning and reading, I discovered Head First design pattern and after reading it's first chapter, I was thrilled. Now I can say that was basics but it's easier to get to know about advance stuff than basics, and there, this books scores. It's a must read book on Object oriented design patterns for any Java developer, including experienced and senior developers. I would even suggest to start learning design pattern from this book. It not only explains concepts in clear way, but also gives lots of diagram, exercise, quizzes and real life examples to make you think and learn. I am a big fan of head first books, be it Head First Java or this book. Head first design patterns is great example of active learning and anyone who wants' to know about Object oriented basics like Inheritance, Encapsulation, Polymorphism and Abstraction, must read this book. There chapter on Decorator design pattern and Observer design pattern is also great piece of work.

这是我读到的第一本Head First系列的书，也是第一本面向对象的书，在此之前，我不知道[如何使用抽象类和接口](http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2013/05/difference-between-abstract-class-vs-interface-java-when-prefer-over-design-oops.html)，我也不知道[为什么组合比接口要好](http://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2013/06/why-favor-composition-over-inheritance-java-oops-design.html)。在最初的几年开发中，我往往根据需求来编写代码，然而在更多的改动，更多的测试之后，往往引入更多的bug。多亏了我的好学精神，我了发现[Head First Design Pattern](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0596007124/?tag=javamysqlanta-20)。读了第一节之后，我感到非常的愉悦。可以说这本书很基础，但是其实学习基础比学习高级的东西更难。这本书真正做到了教会我们基础。它是每一个Java程序员必读的设计模式书籍，包括经验丰富的资深程序员。我也建议学习设计模式就应该从这本书开始。它不仅用清晰的方法解释了概念，还给出了很多图表，练习，测试以及活生生的例子来帮助你思考和吸收。我是head first系列书籍的超级粉丝，就是因为[Head First Java](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0596009208/?tag=javamysqlanta-20)和[Head First Design Pattern](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0596007124/?tag=javamysqlanta-20)。Head First Design Pattern中有很多很棒的例子，任何想要学习面向对象基础的人（譬如接口，封装，多态，抽象等）都应该读读这本书。其中装饰模式(Decorator design pattern)和观察者模式(Observer design pattern)是非常好的两个章节。


Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, John Vlissides

This is the classic Gang of Four (GOF) design pattern book, which became source and motivation for many object oriented design pattern books written and published so far. Any list of must read books on design patterns in Java is incomplete, without including this book. After almost 20 years, this book is still relevant on Object oriented and Java design patterns.  This book has a case study chapter on designing Document Editor and then explains various design patterns e.g. Creational patterns, Structural and Behavioral patterns. IMHO, this is one of the best book in design pattern and must read for any Java developer, along with Java concurrency in Practice and Effective Java. You can buy this book from amazon, it’s available as both hardcover, paperback edition and as multimedia CD.

这是四人帮(GOF)的经典设计模式的书籍，它也是很多其他的面向对象设计模式书籍所借鉴的对象。如果关于设计模式的必读清单上没有这本书，那便是不完整的。出版了接近20年之后，这本书的主题依然紧贴面向对象和设计模式理论。这本书围绕着设计一个文档编辑器的例子，分别解释了多种设计模式，如Creational patterns, Structural and Behavioral patterns。个人浅见，这本书是最好的设计模式书籍。对于每个Java程序员来说，这本书以及[Java concurrency in Practice](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0321349601/?tag=javamysqlanta-20)和[Effective Java](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0321356683/?tag=javamysqlanta-20)都是必读书籍。你可以从亚马逊上购买这本书，有纸质版的，也有多媒体CD。

Design Patterns Explained: A New Perspective on Object-Oriented Design (2nd Edition) by Alan Shalloway, James R. Trott

Like multithreading and concurrency, design patterns are also not easy to understand. What is most difficult part is understanding enough to identify real world scenarios, where you can apply these design patterns. That's why sometime it's better to use multiple books to learn design patterns in Java, it's worth doing it. Main reason for that is, different style of writing and explaining stuffs. Some programmer find a particular author more readable than others, I guess only exception is Joshua Bloch which really connects to most of Java developer. Design Patterns Explained: A New Perspective on Object-Oriented Design, is that alternate way of learning Object oriented design pattern. Though it also explains same set of OOPS principles, UML and design patterns like decorator, factory or observer, the way it explains may be easier to understand for many beginners. Examples given this design pattern books is also good and non trivial.

就像多线程和并发一样，设计模式也不容易理解。其中最困难的部分就是理解之后应用到真实的例子中去。这就是为什么要多读几本Java的设计模式的书，非常值得这么做。因为对于某些程序员来说，某个作者的写作风格比其他作者更易读。但是Joshua Bloch是个例外，他的写作风格被部分程序员都适用。《Design Patterns Explained: A New Perspective on Object-Oriented Design》这本书是学习面相对象设计模式的另一本书。虽然它也没有什么新内容，也介绍了面向对象理论，UML以及装饰者模式、工厂模式、观察者模式等设计模式。但是它对于很多初学者来说更通俗易懂。这本书里的例子也非常棒。

Software Architecture Design Patterns in Java by Partha Kuchana

This is a another good book on Object oriented and Java design patterns, it not only covers basic Object-oriented principles like Class, Object, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction and Encapsulation, but also covers details which is quite practical but not obvious e.g. private methods, getter and setters, Immutable objects, interface and monitor. This book also provide extensive and comprehensive coverage of whole lot of design patterns e.g. Creational patterns, Collection patterns, Structural patterns, Behavioral patterns, and Concurrency patterns. It's coverage on Factory design pattern and Singleton pattern is really interesting to read. Another thing, which I like in this book is practice questions and UML diagrams, which not only helps to understand topic well but also ensures that you practice application part, which is most important to learn any design pattern. Finally they have a case study of designing software solution for a web hosting company, which gives you a real chance of identifying and applying design patterns in a real world scenario. In short, Software Architecture Design Patterns in Java has almost everything you need to know about Java design patterns.    

这是这个主题的又一本书，它不仅涵盖了所有的面向对象基础(类，对象，继承，多态，抽象，封装)，也包括了一些实用但不明显的细节，譬如私有方法，getter和setter方法，不可变对象，接口和监视器(monitor)。这本书还有一些更深入的面向对象的知识，如创建模式(Creational patterns), 集合模式(Collection patterns), 结构模式(Structural patterns), 行为模式(Behavioral patterns),和并发(Concurrency patterns)。对于工厂模式和单例模式的讲述也很有趣。我喜欢这本书的另一个原因在于，有很多实用的问题和UML图表，这样不仅能更深入的理解问题，也可以在实际应用方面有所帮助，实用也正是学习设计模式最重要的作用。最后这本书通过为网络主机公司设计软件的实例学习，来让我们将设计模式应用在真实的场景中。简而言之，《Software Architecture Design Patterns in Java》可以帮助你全面学习设计模式。

Core J2EE Patterns: Best Practices and Design Strategies (2nd Edition) by Deepak Alur, Dan Malks, and John Crupi

J2EE platform is most popular way of using Java programming language, and since it's mainly focus on web and enterprise solution, it has it's own set of problems and requirements. Core J2EE patterns explains some of the most useful design patterns from J2EE world e.g. Intercepting Filters, Front Controller, Model View Controller or MVC pattern, Data Access Object or DAO pattern, View Helper or View Resolver pattern, Service Locator patterns etc. This book divides design pattern based upon there functional area e.g. Presentation tier design patterns, business tier design pattern etc. This is a must read book for any Java J2EE developer, who is responsible for coding web application and enterprise application. Though modern day framework like Spring, ensures you follow these J2EE design pattern at framework level e.g. MVC is enforced by Spring MVC, similarly it also uses Front Controller in form of DispatcherServlet and ViewResolver. Spring framework, also let you use dependency Injection and IOC at container level. Having said that, whether you use Spring MVC, Struts or any other web framework, knowledge of these J2EE patterns will help you to understand legacy code as well as to create solution which is easier to maintain.

J2EE平台是Java程序语言的最流行的开发方法，它主要专注于解决网络和企业的问题，有一套自己的问题和需求。核心的J2EE模式描述了一些最有用的J2EE世界的设计模式，譬如

Apart from these 5 books you can also look on Effective Java 2nd Edition by Joshua Bloch and Head first object oriented analysis and design for getting some good idea about object oriented design principles and how it has used in Java. Effective Java is must read for any Java programmer, as it explained lot of practical design advices used in Java library itself.
